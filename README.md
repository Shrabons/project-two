# Examples

We have several examples [on the website.]() Here is the first one to get you started

```javascript
function ami() {
  console.log("this is a anme");
}
ami();
```

# Html syntex

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>pull</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>this is two project</h1>
    <h2>the name is a ruhol</h2>

    <script src="./js/script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Git manage

manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the

```
git init
git add
git commit -m "this is  demo"
git push -u origin main / master
```
